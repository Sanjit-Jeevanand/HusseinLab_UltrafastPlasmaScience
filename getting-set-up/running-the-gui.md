# Running the GUI

Once the code is installed and the Pi is serially connected and running uart\_receiver.py (if using the stage version), then you can change directories into the desired folder and run the GUI.

```bash
# Replace "LIBS_withStage" with "LIBS" to run the non-stage version instead
cd ./HusseinLab_UltrafastPlasmaScience/LIBS_withStage
python3 LIBS_GUI.py
```

Alternatively, you can run the code through an IDE like Anaconda.
