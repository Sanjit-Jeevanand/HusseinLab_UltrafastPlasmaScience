# Endnotes

Yay you made it to the end!

If you are inheriting this project, I hope my code isn't too awful haha. Feel free to contact me and tell me how I could've done a better job or how decent it is. In general, most of the system is complete, but writing clean code and UX/UI can be greatly improved on.



I'd like to acknowledge and thank Shubho Mohajan for constantly giving me advice and for writing half of the code. Additionally Shubho was of great help during the whole hardware planning and troubleshooting phase. Thank you Nick Brier for your advice and guidance and thank you Amina Hussein for giving me this great opportunity and championing me.&#x20;
