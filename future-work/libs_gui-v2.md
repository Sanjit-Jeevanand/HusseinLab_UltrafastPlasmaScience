# LIBS\_GUI V2

Repository: [https://github.com/Ying-SunWan/LIBSGUI\_V2.git](https://github.com/Ying-SunWan/LIBSGUI\_V2.git)

This code is everything LIBS\_GUI does, but with more modularized code and some user experience improvements. Each hardware component now has its own file so troubleshooting and changing lines is easier. If you inherit this project after me, this may be a good place to start. Just keep in mind, this code has had very limited testing from me, so there are still likely bugs that will need to be squashed.
