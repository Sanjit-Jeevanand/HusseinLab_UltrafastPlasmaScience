# Single Shot

### How To

* All parameters in the Spectrometers tab must be filled and "Set"
* The delay generator must be on and ensure the spectrometers and motors are connected.
* The stage must be at home ("Single Shot" button will be disabled otherwise)
* All inputs in the "Raster" side (right half) of the Translation Stage tab must be filled&#x20;

Once all of the above is complete, click the "Single Shot" button and the stage will begin moving and saving data. It will also print the number of shots taken so you can keep track of its progress.

### Stopping

Hitting the "Stop" button for whatever reason takes 2 more steps before fully stopping. If it is an emergency, you're better off unplugging the entire system.
